## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Initialize:** On page load, the application initializes by fetching files from a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.
2. **Display Files:** It retrieves and displays files and directories in a list. Directories are clickable to navigate deeper, and files are listed with their download links.
3. **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Shows the current path as a breadcrumb trail, allowing users to navigate back to parent directories.
4. **Dark Mode:** Users can toggle between light and dark modes. The preference is saved in localStorage and applied on subsequent visits.
5. **Dynamic Updates:** The file list and breadcrumb trail update dynamically based on user navigation within the repository.

## ⭐ Features

- **Interactive Directory Listing:** View and navigate through files and directories.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Easily track and navigate through the directory structure.
- **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes with a toggle.

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
